We ascribe the high catalytic activity to a nickel phosphine/magnesium alkoxide bimetallic species that forms from the nickel precatalyst, the PO ligand, and the Grignard reagent and undergoes activation of the aryl?X bond by a cooperative push?pull action of the nucleophilic nickel and Lewis acidic magnesium centers. This mechanistic conjecture was corroborated by kinetic isotope effect experiments and density functional theory calculations.

The present study reports a thorough theoretical analysis of Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling between aryl esters and arylboronic acids, with an emphasis on explaining the cause for the surprising selectivity in C?O activation. The overall catalytic cycle is found to include three basic steps: oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination. Oxidative addition of Ar?OAc to Ni(0) in the presence of PCy3 ligand proceeds through the monophosphine pathway (instead of the alternative two-phosphine pathway) with a relatively low barrier of +22.9 kcal/mol. Transmetalation proceeds via a base-assisted mechanism with a barrier of +31.2 kcal/mol. Reductive elimination is the most facile step in the whole catalytic cycle. Comparatively, oxidative addition of ArO?Ac to Ni(0) is a more facile process (barrier = +14.2 kcal/mol) than oxidative addition of Ar?OAc to Ni(0). However, the former process is associated with a fairly low reverse barrier, and its product does not transmetalate easily (barrier = +33.1 kcal/mol). By comparison, the latter process is an irreversible reaction, and its product transmetalates more readily. These results explain why only the cross-coupling products from the Ar?OAc activation (but not from the ArO?Ac activation) were observed in experiments.",8,Inert,B,538.8856603973086,-307.7088813,11,No Journal,No Reaction,J.
